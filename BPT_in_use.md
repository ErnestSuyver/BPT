## BPT in use

### Brill publications that use BPT

All dynamic publications on _Brill Scholarly Editions_ use BPT. One uses BPT in a pipeline.

Somne static publications  on _Brill Scholarly Editions_ were created from BPT. (Others straight from TEI XMl; the intention is to convert them into BPT too).

### Lessons learned

For complex texts (such as most of the text editions) BPT comes close to TEI. The advantage of simplicity (human readability) is much reduced.

Simplicity is only maintained if stand-off annotation is used. And complexity can onlty be added _after_ conversion onto other formats.

### roadmap

See Trello. First on the roadmap is the addition of Leiden+ and the option to create additional levels of textparts.
