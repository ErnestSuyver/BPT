## BPT is for humans

### Background

Brill's [workflow](https://brillpublishers.gitlab.io/documentation-workflow/) for creating, editing, and publishing content is based on plain text. This means that whatever the source format, the content is converted into plain text. The plain text is processed, enriched, and converted into other formats for publication, exchange, or archiving.

The selected plain text format is [MarkDown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), supplemented by some Brill-specific extensions. Hence the name _Brill Plain Text_, or BPT for short.

BPT supports the inclusion of additional mark-up, such as Leiden+ for epigraphical texts, YAML for metadata and references, and HTML.

<!--
After conversion to plain text, the content may be further processed. For example, it can be copy-edited, indexed, and converted into TEI XML for publication on Brill's [Scholarly Edition site](https://labs.brill.com/se/). 

By default, such processes are automated and take place in GitLab, which not only is the version control system, but acts as the entire pipeline for this workflow.

### For people

BPT is meant to be simple. No knowledge preusupposed. Experience has shown that XML is an obstacle to most authors and editors. 

### Semantic

BPT is a *content format* rather than a data format or typographical format. It deals with meaning.
