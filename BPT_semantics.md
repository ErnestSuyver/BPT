# BPT is semantic

### Meaning

BPT is a *content format* rather than a data format or typographical format. It deals with meaning. In this, it resembles TEI or HTML (to which it must be converted).

This means the markers ("tags") represent _meaning_. For example, it identifies a line as a line, i.e a textpart, rather than as a typographical unit.
