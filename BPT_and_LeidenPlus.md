## BPT and Leiden+ 


Leiden+ is for Epigraphy and Papyrology.

BPT supports the inclusion of [Leiden+](http://papyri.info/docs/leiden_plus).

Leiden+ is a unified and consistent system of mark up signs used in the edition of epigraphical and papyrological texts.

Leiden+ is plain text. For example, in Leiden+, every block of text must be enclosed in a `<= ... =>` pair.

See the [Guidelines](https://brillpublishers.gitlab.io/documentation-seg) for _Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum_ for an example of how Leiden+ is used in a Brill publication.
